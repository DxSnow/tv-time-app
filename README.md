# TvTimeApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

If you know a TV or Web show's full name but don't know where and when to watch it. This website can help you. 

Minimalist. No distractions. Reactive. These are the user experiences we want to provides.

This is a group project I worked with Gunneet and James. It's our first Angular project, as well as our first team collaboration.
