# TvTimeApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

If you know a TV or Web show's full name but don't know where and when to watch it. This website can help you. 

Minimalist. No distractions. Reactive. These are the user experiences we want to provides. 
In this world where everyone else wants to get you in and never let you go by giving you unsolicited content, we just want you to get what you want and let you go!
If you want to use 1 minute in you life to search a tv show. You'll only spend 1 minute here.
